Benchmarking Streaming JSON implementations

This is a simple project illustrating testing of various json implementaions that are based on streaming api, i.e. low memory footprint and unix like coding style.

The dummy jason as based on the data from the npm repository.

Intention is to try and add more and more implementaions or languages testing on this.


To run execute the ruby script at the project's root:

    ruby benchmark.rb
